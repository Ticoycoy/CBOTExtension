HELLO!

This is a video tutorial on how to implement one Click update on Extension.

1. Download the extension via https://cb-phaa.web.app/downloads/ or https://admin-cb-phaa.web.app/uploads
2. Extract the file to your designated folder
3. Load unpacked extension on your browser, target the public folder inside the extracted file.
4. Copy the Extension ID that will be seen on the extension details.
5. Go to the extracted folder and open the folder native_host
6. Find and run the file install_native_host.py
7. Paste the extension id on the command line then press enter twice!
8. Log on to the extension and click the download icon or update button before the logout button.

This updater will automatically change the file on the extension folder to the updated one from the GitHub repository pushed by the developer.

Let's Automate!! ENJOY!
